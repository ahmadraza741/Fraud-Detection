# Fraud-Detection
As the number of fraudulent has increased during transaction, there is a need to eradicate this issue. Hence, this project is made to solve this problem.
I have taken a dataset from kaggle "Credit Card fraud detection" and performed some data preprocessing and data visualisation in order to get insights out of it. I have used a Logistic regression model as it was a binary classification problem.
0- Legit Transaction
1- Fraud transaction

Fitting the test data in the model has given the efficiency of 94.42%.
